#### Changing the Screen Colors

Sometimes due to eye strain or personal preference, you may wish to view the screen in different colors. If you do not need color accuracy and are just trying to read the text as comfortably as possible, you might want to experiment with changing the screen colors. Color inversion exchanges color values. For example, black text on a white screen becomes white text on a black screen.

To change the screen color while using Magnifier press Control + Alt + I. This will invert the colors to white text on a black background. This is a toggle so you can return the colors to normal by pressing the hotkey again.

You can also use the user interface to enable this setting with the following steps:

1.  Bring the Magnifier user interface up by clicking on it in the taskbar if it is not already up.

2.  Click on the gear icon.

3.  Click the checkbox for Turn on color inversion.

4.  Press Enter or click OK.

3.  Click on schemes and choose another scheme for the mouse, then click OK.

### Cursor Enhancements

Cursor enhancements in Magnifier are extremely limited and vary depending upon which version of Microsoft Windows you are using. In Windows 10, you can change the thickness of the cursor by using the following steps.

1.  Press the Windows key to bring up the Start Menu.

2.  Type "Cursor" and a gear with the phrase "Change how thick the cursor is" should appear at the top of the list.
