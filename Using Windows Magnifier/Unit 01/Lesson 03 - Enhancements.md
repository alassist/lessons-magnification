#### Changing the Screen Colors

Sometimes due to eye strain or personal preference, you may wish to view the screen in different colors. If you do not need color accuracy and are just trying to read the text as comfortably as possible, you might want to experiment with changing the screen colors. Color inversion exchanges color values. For example, black text on a white screen becomes white text on a black screen.

To change the screen color while using Magnifier press Control + Alt + I. This will invert the colors to white text on a black background. This is a toggle so you can return the colors to normal by pressing the hotkey again.

You can also use the user interface to enable this setting with the following steps:

1.  Bring the Magnifier user interface up by clicking on it in the taskbar if it is not already up.

2.  Click on the gear icon.

3.  Click the checkbox for Turn on color inversion.

4.  Press Enter or click OK.

### Cursor and Pointer Enhancements

If you have trouble finding the mouse cursor you have several options to increase its visibility built in to Windows. Starting in Windows 10 build 1903, you have enhanced cursor options.


This setting must be changed using the Windows Control Panel.

1.  Open the Start Menu and type "pointer" (minus the quotes) and press Enter.

2.  Use the slider to change the size of your pointer.
3.  Select one of the options below that to change your pointer color. You have 4 options:
  - White: White pointer
  - Black: Black pointer
  - Inverse: This will make your mouse the inverse color from whatever is under it.
  - Color Wheel: This will give you the option of picking from standard colors or a custom color. 

### Cursor Enhancements

Cursor enhancements in Windows are extremely limited and vary depending upon which version of Microsoft Windows you are using. In Windows 10, you can change the thickness of the cursor by using the cursor thickness slider. Note that this is the editing cursor and not the one that moves with your mouse.
