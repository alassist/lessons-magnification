### Introduction

**What is a screen magnifier? - From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_magnifier):**

A screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content. It is a type of assistive technology suitable for visually impaired people with some functional vision; visually impaired people with little or no functional vision usually use a screen reader.

This tutorial discusses 3 main Screen Magnification applications. These are Microsoft’s [Magnifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnifier_(Windows)) application, Ai Squared’s [ZoomText](http://www.zoomtext.com/products/zoomtext-magnifierreader/), and Freedom Scientific’s [MAGic](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/LowVision/MAGic).

### Definitions

**Screen Magnifier** - A screen magnifier magnifies whatever is displayed on the screen to make it easier to see.

**Zoom Window** - A zoom window is an area of the screen that is magnified. There are usually several choices to choose from which include: lens, top of screen, bottom of screen, line, and full.

**Text Cursor** - A cursor is a blinking vertical line that indicates where the next letters typed will appear. When typing the cursor will stay to the right of the text being typed.

**Mouse Pointer** - An icon that indicates where the mouse is on the screen. It can have numerous shapes. When on text where you can type it will look like the capital letter I, when on a link it will look like a pointing hand, when waiting it will look like an arrowhead with a circle beside it, and when on an area that you cannot type on or on a button it will be shaped like an arrowhead.

**Font** - The appearance of the letters when typed and/or printed. For instance, some fonts are in bold type whereas others may look like handwriting, or be enlarged in size. When adjusting the font you can change the size, thickness of the lines to form the letter, color, and where the letter appears on the line. Font size is adjusted in points, which is basically is a unit of measurement in typography. It is 1/72 of an inch. Therefore 10 point is 10/72 of an inch.

**Menu** - a set of features arranged together to make it easier to locate. Most menus are on a menu bar usually at or near the top of the screen. For instance, the file menu contains features saving or opening files.

**Hotkey** - a key command to perform a specific function without having to go through the menus. For instance, you can press control S to save a file instead of opening the File Menu and choosing save. When using hotkeys you should first press and hold down the first key listed such as when pressing control + S to save, hold down control, then press S quickly and release both keys.

**Tracking** - the ability for the screen magnifier to follow different elements. Without cursor tracking, you could be typing a long passage of text, and the text goes off the screen while the magnifier stays stationary. Tracking enables the screen magnifier to follow along as you type and ensure that the area you are working on is magnified.
