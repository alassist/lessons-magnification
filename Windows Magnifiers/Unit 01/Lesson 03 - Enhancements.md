#### Changing the Screen Colors

Sometimes due to eye strain or personal preference, you may wish to view the screen in different colors. If you do not need color accuracy and are just trying to read the text as comfortably as possible, you might want to experiment with changing the screen colors. Color inversion exchanges color values. For example, black text on a white screen becomes white text on a black screen.
